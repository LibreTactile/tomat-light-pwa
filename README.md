# tomat-light-pwa
Simulation of TOMAT navigator hardware built with PWA

**Mobile Derivative of TOMAT Navigator**
*A multimodal mobile interface for nonlinear, accessible interaction*

**TOMAT Light** brings the [TOMAT Navigator](https://github.com/LibreTactile/tomat) experience to smartphone through PWA. Paired with a tactile grid (3D-printed or printed on paper), it enables **nonlinear, multimodal navigation** through audio and haptic feedback —making apps, files, and settings more accessible to blind and visually impaired users.

Screen readers often force linear navigation. TOMAT Light offers a **spatial, touch-based alternative**, enabling users to explore and jump between elements intuitively.

> No TOMAT hardware? Just print the grid for your phone. Get TOMAT’s benefits—no extra equipment required.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔁 Core Interaction

* **Tactile navigation** using tactile overlay and PWA-powered software
* **Multiscale views**: Zoom between categories and details (apps, files, links)

### ♿ Accessibility

* **Screen reader–compatible** (tested with NVDA)
* **Gesture & audio feedback**: Tap, double-tap, hold with contextual sounds

### 🛠️ Assistive UX Highlights

* **Haptic states**:

  * `INACTIVE`: No feedback
  * `ACTIVE`: Continuous vibration
  * `PULSATING`: Rhythmic pulses
* **Multi-touch detection** with adaptive feedback
* **Real-time updates**: Remote apps can change button states live
* **Low-vision friendly**: Non-visual interaction model with audio/tactile cues

## 🤲 About TOMAT

The [TOMAT Navigator](https://github.com/libretactile/tomat) is an open-source assistive device co-designed with blind users. It provides **touchable web maps** that make navigation faster, more intuitive, and spatially meaningful.

* **Touch, listen, navigate**: Explore headings, links, and sections with your fingers and screen reader
* **Break linearity**: Skip directly to key areas
* **Designed with users**: Refined over six rounds of blind user feedback
* **Part of an ecosystem**: Browser extension, IDE tools, smart device support
